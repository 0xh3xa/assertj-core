Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FEST Guava assertions!  
We appreciate your effort, but to make sure that the inclusion of your patch is a smooth process, we ask that you make note of the following guidelines.

* **Use [FEST code formatting preferences](https://raw.github.com/alexruiz/fest-eclipse-preferences/master/formatter.xml).**
* **Write complete Javadocs on assertion methods with a code example.**
* **Write one JUnit test class for each assertion method**, do not put all the tests in one file. 
* **Use FEST unit tests naming convention** that is underscore based and not camel case lile the rest of the code, 
** successfull assertions unit test name should start with : `should_pass`.
** failing assertions unit test name should start with : `should_fail`.
